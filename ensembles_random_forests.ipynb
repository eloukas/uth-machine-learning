    "**Ensemble learning (or \"ensembling\")** is the process of combining several predictive models in order to produce a combined model that is more accurate than any individual model. For example, given predictions from several models we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression:** Take the average of the predictions.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Take a vote and use the most common prediction.\n",

    "**Which model is best?** The best classifier for a particular task is task-dependent. In many business cases, interpretability is more important than accuracy. So, decision trees may be preferred. In other cases, accuracy on unseen data might be paramount, in which case random forests would likely be better (since they typically overfit less). \n",

By making the model more stable, we necessarily make it fit the training data less accurately. In some cases this is desired (particularly if we start with lots of overfitting), but for more simply structured data a simple decision tree might be best.\n",
